%=============================
\section{General Information}
This section provides an overview of the Crazy Tens project, outlining the software's purpose, key functionalities, and educational goals. It also defines the objectives of the verification and validation process, prioritizes quality attributes, assesses the challenge level and potential extras, and references supporting documentation to ensure alignment with project requirements.

%-----------------------------
\subsection{Summary}
The software being verified and validated is called \textbf{The Crazy Tens – A Counting Game}. It is an educational web-based card game designed to help users learn and practice arithmetic operations in different number bases, primarily Dozenal (Base 12) and Decimal (Base 10). The game provides interactive gameplay, Dozenal arithmetic challenges, score tracking, and base-conversion explanations to promote understanding of number systems.  

Key functionalities (adapted from the \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} Section 9) include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initiating and joining game sessions with other users in real time.
    \item Enforcing turn-based gameplay and validating moves under Dozenal rules.
    \item Calculating and displaying scores in both Decimal and Dozenal forms.
    \item Managing user profiles, accounts, and persistent game data.
    \item Providing Dozenal hints and explanations to reinforce learning objectives.
\end{itemize}
Educational support functions (FR 8–9) are considered out of scope for testing at this stage.

%-----------------------------

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

%-----------------------------
\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsubsection{Challenge Level}
In the beginning of the course, Professor Smith classified our challenge level as \textbf{basic}, as we were initially building a simple web-based card game. However, with additional features—multiple number-base decks, player authentication and matching, database persistence, and a reduced team of four—the project scope now fits an \textbf{intermediate} challenge level.

\subsubsection{Extras}
\paragraph{Norman’s Principles Report}
This extra is practical for our project because the graphical user interface and interaction design are central to player engagement and learning. Applying Norman’s principles helps refine visual cues and user feedback, both essential for usability and educational clarity.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Visibility} – Ensures players can easily identify playable cards and actions.  
    \item \textbf{Feedback} – Provides immediate visual and auditory responses to user moves.  
    \item \textbf{Affordance} – GUI elements (buttons, cards) clearly suggest their use.  
    \item \textbf{Mapping} – Card and control layouts intuitively match player expectations.  
    \item \textbf{Constraints} – Prevents illegal moves or inputs via interface restrictions.  
    \item \textbf{Consistency} – Uniform design promotes comfort and predictability across sessions.  
\end{itemize}
Evaluating the design through these principles promotes balanced usability and pedagogical effectiveness.

\paragraph{Usability Report}
For this extra, we will conduct structured usability testing following HCI best practices. The testing will include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clearly defined testing goals and quantifiable success criteria.  
    \item Predefined gameplay tasks (e.g., start match, make valid move, view results).  
    \item Post-session surveys assessing clarity, engagement, and satisfaction.  
\end{itemize}
This extra will help quantify user experience metrics and identify friction points prior to final rollout, ensuring the game is both intuitive and enjoyable for its educational audience.

%-----------------------------
\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SRS} – \href{https://github.com/The-Crazy-Four-Games/Crazy-Eights-Game/blob/main/docs/SRS-Volere/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}  
    \item \textbf{MG} – \href{https://github.com/The-Crazy-Four-Games/Crazy-Eights-Game/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide (MG)}  
    \item \textbf{MIS} – \href{https://github.com/The-Crazy-Four-Games/Crazy-Eights-Game/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{Module Interface Specification (MIS)}  
\end{itemize}

Each of these documents contributes essential context for this plan:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{SRS} defines all functional and non-functional requirements forming the foundation for test design.  
    \item The \textbf{MG} describes the software architecture and module interactions that are verified through design and integration testing.  
    \item The \textbf{MIS} specifies detailed module interfaces and data flows necessary for unit-level verification and static analysis.  
\end{itemize}
Together, they ensure complete traceability from requirements to design and testing.

\section{System Tests}

This section defines end to end system tests that validate the software against the \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} Functional Requirements (FR-1..FR-17) for the MVP implementation state. Tests are grouped by related functionality to improve traceability and reuse of fixtures. Unless stated otherwise, tests assume a deterministic deck seed, two authenticated test users, and a clean database. All expected results are observable via the UI and server state exposed to the test harness.

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The subsections below cover: (1) game flow, rule validation, special cards, and end conditions (\href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} Game Manager: FR-1..FR-5), (2) scoring and valid move highlighting (\href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} Score Manager and Highlighting: FR-6..FR-9), (3) account access flows (Login Manager: FR-10..FR-13), and (4) persistence operations (Data Manager: FR-14..FR-17). Where tests rely on input constraints, they use the card value and move legality definitions in the \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.

\subsubsection{Game Manager: Start, Turn, Rules, Specials, End (FR-1..FR-5)}

This area verifies new game initialization, turn sequencing, rule validation for same suit or same value or sum equals 12 (base-12), handling of wild tens, and detecting the end of a game. It directly traces to FR-1 Start new game, FR-2 Turn management, FR-3 Rule validation, FR-4 Special cards, FR-5 End of game.

\paragraph{Start new game initializes state (ST-GM-01)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-01\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} No active sessions. Two users are authenticated and in the lobby. Deterministic deck seed S is configured.

\textbf{Input:} User A clicks New Game and invites User B. User B accepts.

\textbf{Output:} A new session is created with a shuffled deck using seed S, a discard starter card is placed, each player receives the configured hand size H, and the UI shows turn = User A.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} From FR-1 and \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} deck initialization semantics. With a fixed seed S, the initial state is uniquely determined.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Run a Node console harness that calls \texttt{initGame('S')}, then logs and checks via simple equality that \texttt{hands} have size H, \texttt{discard.length == 1}, and \texttt{turn == UserA}. No browser, no sockets.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Legal move: same suit (ST-GM-02)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-02\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Active session. Discard top = 5$\heartsuit$. User A hand contains K$\heartsuit$ and others. Turn = User A.

\textbf{Input:} User A plays K$\heartsuit$.

\textbf{Output:} Move is accepted. Discard top becomes K$\heartsuit$. Turn advances to User B.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-3 allows a move when suits match.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} In the console harness set \texttt{discard = [{suit:'H',v:5}]} and handA contains K$\heartsuit$. Call \texttt{canPlay()} then \texttt{playCard()}. Log PASS if top becomes K$\heartsuit$ and turn flips to UserB.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Legal move: sum equals 12 (base-12) (ST-GM-03)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-03\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Discard top = 5$\diamondsuit$ (value 5). User A hand contains 7$\spadesuit$ (value 7). Turn = User A.

\textbf{Input:} User A plays 7$\spadesuit$.

\textbf{Output:} Move is accepted. Discard top becomes 7$\spadesuit$. Turn advances to User B.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} In base-12, 5 + 7 = 10$_{12}$ which equals 12 in decimal. FR-3 permits play when values sum to 12 base-12.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Set top to value 5 then attempt to play value 7. Use \texttt{canPlay()} to assert true and log PASS.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Special card: wild ten suit selection (ST-GM-04)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-04\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Discard top = K$\clubsuit$. User A hand contains 8$\heartsuit$. Turn = User A.

\textbf{Input:} User A plays 8$\heartsuit$ and selects Spades as the new suit.

\textbf{Output:} Move is accepted. Discard shows 8 with chosen suit indicator = Spades. Only Spades or otherwise legal responses are allowed for the next player.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-4 specifies 8s are wild and allow the player to declare a suit.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Give A an 8, play with \linebreak 
\texttt{playCard(state,'A',eight,\{chooseSuit:'S'\})}, then check \texttt{chosenSuit == 'S'} and \texttt{turn == 'B'} via console logs.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Illegal move is rejected with guidance (ST-GM-05)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-05\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Discard top = 9$\diamondsuit$. User A hand contains Q$\clubsuit$ and no other legal card.

\textbf{Input:} User A attempts to play Q$\clubsuit$.

\textbf{Output:} Move is rejected. UI shows a polite message explaining why the move is invalid and highlights available actions: draw or play a legal card if any.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-3 rejects moves that are not same suit, not same value, and do not sum to 12 base-12.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{canPlay()} on an invalid card and expect \texttt{false}. For now we just assert the engine rejects the move; UI message will be verified later in UI tests.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{End of game detection (ST-GM-06)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-GM-06\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} User A has 1 card, which is legal to play. User B has multiple cards.

\textbf{Input:} User A plays the last card.

\textbf{Output:} Game ends. Winner = User A. System transitions to score calculation and displays results.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-5 requires ending the game when a player has no cards left.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Have a scripted state where A has one legal card, call \texttt{playCard()}, then log PASS if \texttt{state.status == 'Completed'} and \texttt{winner == 'A'}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Score Features: Dual-base, Highlights (FR-6..FR-9)}

This area validates round scoring in decimal and Dozenal, correct conversion and display, and visual highlighting of valid moves. Education Support and hints are out of scope.

\paragraph{Score calculated and shown in decimal and Dozenal (ST-SC-01)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-01\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Game just ended. Opponent remaining cards have numeric values 2, 4, 6 (per \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} value function).

\textbf{Input:} Trigger score calculation screen.

\textbf{Output:} Decimal total = 12. Dozenal total = 10$_{12}$. Both are displayed side by side.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} 2 + 4 + 6 = 12 decimal which equals 10 in base-12.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{calculateScore(\{B:[2,4,6]\})} and expect \texttt{\{ decimal:12, dozenal:'10' \}}. Log PASS or FAIL.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Valid moves highlighted exactly (ST-SC-03)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-03\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Discard top = 4$\spadesuit$. Hand contains 4$\clubsuit$, 8$\diamondsuit$, 7$\heartsuit$, Q$\spadesuit$, 6$\clubsuit$.

\textbf{Input:} None beyond rendering the hand.

\textbf{Output:} Highlighted cards are exactly \{4$\clubsuit$, Q$\spadesuit$, 8$\diamondsuit$\}. 7$\heartsuit$ and 6$\clubsuit$ are not highlighted.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Same value (4), same suit (Spades), and wild eight are valid. Others are invalid because 7 + 4 = 11 decimal which is not 10$_{12}$ and 6 + 4 = 10 decimal which is not 10$_{12}$.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call exported \texttt{listValidMoves(state, hand)} and assert it returns exactly the IDs for same value, same suit, and wild eight. Log PASS or FAIL.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Primary base toggle affects labeling only (ST-SC-04)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-SC-04\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Score view shows decimal on the left and Dozenal on the right with decimal as primary.

\textbf{Input:} Toggle primary base to Dozenal.

\textbf{Output:} Labels and prominence swap, but numeric values remain identical pair \{12, 10$_{12}$\}. No recomputation changes total values.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-7 specifies dual display; the toggle is a presentation choice.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} For MVP engine tests, verify the conversion outputs are stable. The UI toggle is deferred; assert that conversion of 12 dec remains $10_{12}$ before and after calling a \texttt{setPrimaryBase()} no-op stub.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Login Manager: Account, Sessions, Guest, Validation (FR-10..FR-13)}

This area verifies account creation, login and logout, guest sessions, and credential checks.

\paragraph{Account creation creates unique user and session (ST-LM-01)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-LM-01\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} No account exists for username \texttt{U}. Clean auth store.

\textbf{Input:} Submit sign up with \texttt{username=U}, \texttt{password=P} that meets policy.

\textbf{Output:} Account is created with unique \texttt{userId}. Password is stored as a salted hash (not plaintext). A logged-in session for \texttt{U} is active.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-10 requires creation with unique username and password.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} In Node harness call \texttt{createAccount(U,P)}. Assert \texttt{store.users[U].passwordHash} exists and \texttt{store.sessions.has(userId)}. Then attempt a second \texttt{createAccount(U,P2)} and assert rejection.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Login and logout preserve progress (ST-LM-02)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-LM-02\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Account \texttt{U} exists with prior game history \texttt{H0}. No active session.

\textbf{Input:} \texttt{login(U,P)} then start a game, finish one hand, \texttt{logout()}, then \texttt{login(U,P)}.

\textbf{Output:} Session is established on both logins. After re-login, history includes prior \texttt{H0} plus the new hand \texttt{H1}. No progress is lost at logout.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-11 requires login and logout at any time without losing progress.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{login}, run minimal game through engine hooks, call \texttt{logout}, then \texttt{login} again. Compare history count before and after.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Guest mode creates temporary session (ST-LM-03)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-LM-03\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} No active session.

\textbf{Input:} \texttt{createGuestSession()} then play a short hand.

\textbf{Output:} Session has \texttt{guest:true}. No persistent user record is created. On process restart or \texttt{endGuestSession()}, the profile is not retrievable.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-12 allows a temporary session without login.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{createGuestSession()}, verify \texttt{session.guest == true}. Write a hand, restart in-memory store, assert no user profile exists for the guest.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Credential validation gates access (ST-LM-04)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-LM-04\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Account \texttt{U} exists with password \texttt{P}. No active session.

\textbf{Input:} Attempt \texttt{login(U,'wrong')}, then \texttt{login(U,P)}.

\textbf{Output:} First attempt is rejected with an auth error. No session is created. Second attempt succeeds and creates a session.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-13 requires validating credentials against stored records before granting access.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{login} with wrong password and assert failure and \texttt{sessions.size} unchanged, then with correct password and assert success.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Manager: Storage, Retrieval, Update, Deletion (FR-14..FR-17)}

This area verifies secure storage of usernames, game history, and Dozenal scores, along with retrieval, update, and deletion.

\paragraph{User data is stored on events that require persistence (ST-DM-01)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-DM-01\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Authenticated user \texttt{U}. Clean data store.

\textbf{Input:} Finish a game where opponent holds cards with values \{2,4,6\}. Trigger save.

\textbf{Output:} A record exists for \texttt{U} containing username, a new game history entry with decimal total 12 and Dozenal 10$_{12}$.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-14 requires secure storage of user data including game history and Dozenal scores.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{saveGameResult(U, result)}. Assert schema fields exist and values match expected totals. For MVP we verify presence and correctness; deeper security assessments are separate.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Stored data can be retrieved on login or profile view (ST-DM-02)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-DM-02\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Data store contains prior records for \texttt{U}.

\textbf{Input:} \texttt{login(U,P)} then \texttt{getProfile(U)}.

\textbf{Output:} Retrieved profile includes username, cumulative game history, and Dozenal scores as saved.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-15 requires retrieval of stored user data.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Assert \texttt{getProfile(U)} returns non-empty history and last score equals most recent saved value.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Data updates after games and profile changes (ST-DM-03)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-DM-03\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Profile for \texttt{U} exists with history length \texttt{n}.

\textbf{Input:} Complete another game and call \texttt{saveGameResult}. Then change profile display name via \texttt{updateProfile(U,\{displayName:'A'\})}.

\textbf{Output:} History length becomes \texttt{n+1}. Profile \texttt{displayName} is updated. Timestamps reflect the latest update.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-16 requires updating stored data after each game or profile change.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Compare history length and profile fields before and after the operations.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{User can permanently delete data (ST-DM-04)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{ST-DM-04\\}
\textbf{Control:} Automatic

\textbf{Initial State:} Profile and history exist for \texttt{U}.

\textbf{Input:} \texttt{deleteUserData(U)} then attempt \texttt{getProfile(U)} and \texttt{login(U,P)}.

\textbf{Output:} User records, history, and scores are removed. \texttt{getProfile(U)} returns not found. Login is rejected since the account data has been deleted or deactivated per policy.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} FR-17 requires permanent deletion upon request.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} Call \texttt{deleteUserData} and assert data store no longer contains keys for \texttt{U}. Verify subsequent access fails.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

    \subsubsection{Performance and Responsiveness (NFR-1)}
    \textbf{Objective:} Verify that all user interactions, such as playing a card or updating the score, occur with a latency below 200\,ms under normal network conditions. \\

    \textbf{Type:} Dynamic, Automatic \\

    \textbf{Initial State:} Running MVP build on localhost with two authenticated test users and a seeded deck. \\

    \textbf{Input / Condition:} Simulated play sessions of 100 rounds using Playwright scripts. \\

    \textbf{Expected Output / Metric:} Average response time $\leq 200$\,ms, 95th-percentile $\leq 350$\,ms; no dropped WebSocket messages. \\

    \textbf{How test will be performed:}
    Use Playwright performance APIs to measure latency between client events and UI updates. Aggregate results into a summary table through CI (GitHub Actions).
    If thresholds are exceeded, flag the run as a warning and create an issue.

    \subsubsection{Usability and User Satisfaction (NFR-2)}
    \textbf{Objective:} Assess how easily new users can understand and play the Dozenal Crazy Tens game. \\

    \textbf{Type:} Dynamic, Manual \\

    \textbf{Initial State:} Usable prototype deployed on a test server. Five participants who have never played the Dozenal version will take part in a guided session. \\

    \textbf{Input / Condition:} Each participant completes a 15-minute task sequence (start a game, play 3 rounds, view score explanation). \\

    \textbf{Expected Output / Metric:} At least 80\% of participants successfully finish the task without assistance; post-test survey average rating $\geq 4$ (out of 5) on clarity and enjoyment. \\

    \textbf{How test will be performed:}
    Observation and screen recording during gameplay, followed by a 5-question Likert survey (see Appendix 6.2).
    Feedback will be compiled into a usability report.

    \subsubsection{Stability and Robustness (NFR-3)}

    \textbf{How test will be performed:}
    Inject disconnects using Playwright’s network emulation tools. Review browser console and server logs for exceptions. Report mean recovery time and failure rate.

    \subsubsection{Maintainability and Code Quality (NFR-4)}
    \textbf{Objective:} Evaluate source-code consistency and test coverage as indicators of maintainability. \\

    \textbf{Type:} Static Analysis / Automated \\

    \textbf{Initial State:} Repository after successful build on GitHub Actions. \\

    \textbf{Input / Condition:} Run ESLint, Prettier, and CodeQL scans; collect coverage data via Codecov. \\

    \textbf{Expected Output / Metric:} No ESLint errors or critical CodeQL alerts; line coverage $\geq 80$\%. \\

    \textbf{How test will be performed:}
    Continuous Integration pipeline executes static analysis and unit testing jobs on each commit. Results are stored as badges in the repository README for transparency.

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

\newpage{}
\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 

During the writing of this deliverable, our team improved our understanding of how verification and validation activities fit into a software lifecycle.  We learned to trace requirements back to specific tests, and maintain consistency across project documents(\href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} and Supervisor feedbacks). Overall, this deliverable helped us formalize our testing strategy and clarify the expectations for the Crazy Tens project.
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?


Scope drift around base rules and wild card, cross-doc sync issues between \href{../SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} and VnV, and clarifying auth/data flows; we resolved these by parameterizing rules via config and FR ids, adding a small CSV trace matrix and change logs, and specifying salted hashing, session behavior, and delete flows mirrored by tests.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

Collectively we need stronger dynamic and static testing and specific tool skills; Alvin: CI and property-based testing coverage, Ruida: requirements-to-tests traceability and mutation testing, Ammar: authentication and data lifecycle verification, Jiaming: UI highlighting and scoring verification with basic accessibility.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

Alvin will set up GitHub Actions and add fast-check property tests for edge cases because it raises coverage with low overhead; Ruida will build a CSV trace matrix; Ammar will implement salted-hash, session, and CRUD delete tests because auth and data are MVP-critical; Jiaming will create a small Playwright suite and add axe checks in one target browser because it keeps scope focused while covering UI correctness and accessibility.
\end{enumerate}
