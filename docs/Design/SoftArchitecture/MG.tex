\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.


\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes (completed)} \label{SecChange}

This section lists the project changes that we expect (``Likely Changes'') and those we consider unlikely within the capstone timeframe (``Unlikely Changes'').  Where applicable each anticipated change (AC) has been given an identifier to support traceability and to guide module secrets.

\subsection{Likely Changes (each becomes an AC / module secret)}
\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acRules} \actheacnum\ --- Rule Engine Changes:] 
    The validation and behavioural details of the game's rule engine (e.g., how special cards behave, new house rules or alternate base arithmetic rules).  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Rules are likely to be refined during playtesting and instructor feedback, so they should be isolated in the \mref{mRules} module.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acBases} \actheacnum\ --- Numeric Base Support (Dozenal and beyond):] 
    Support for additional numeral systems (Octal, Hex, etc.), and how scores and hints convert and present values.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} We intend the product to be extensible to multiple bases; the conversion logic and scoring changes must be encapsulated in \mref{mBaseConversion}, \mref{mScoring}, and \mref{mScoreboardView}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acScoring} \actheacnum\ --- Scoring Formula / Presentation:] 
    Changes to how round or match scoring is calculated, aggregated or displayed (e.g., bonus rules, alternate tallying).  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Scoring may evolve after playtests; keep scoring logic isolated in \mref{mScoring}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acUI} \actheacnum\ --- UI and Interaction Patterns:] 
    Layout, hint presentation, animations, accessibility adaptations, and onboarding flow.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} UI polish and accessibility tweaks are frequent after usability sessions; the \mref{mAppShell}, \mref{mGameBoardView}, and \mref{mMoveController} should hide these secrets.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acSchema} \actheacnum\ --- Database Schema and Persistence Details:] 
    Changes to the persistent schema (profiles, history, telemetry format) and indexes.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Data collection needs evolve; the \mref{mRepository} module hides these details.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acRealtime} \actheacnum\ --- Real-time Messaging Strategy:] 
    Room lifecycle, message batching, reconnection rules, and state-resync semantics.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Real-time policies affect multiplayer stability; isolate them in \mref{mRealtimeGateway} and \mref{mRealtimeClient}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acAuth} \actheacnum\ --- Authentication and Session Policies:] 
    Token lifetime, guest-session semantics, password storage scheme, and auth flows.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Security/configuration choices can change; these are hidden by \mref{mAuth} and the \mref{mAPI} interface.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes (explicitly documented)}
These items are not expected to change during the capstone, so they are \emph{not} treated as module secrets and are documented rather than encapsulated in a separate module secret:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Target Runtime Platforms:} Modern desktop browsers remain the deployment target for the deliverable.
  \item \textbf{Primary Tech Stack:} Web frontend framework, Server-side JavaScript runtime, Relational database for persistence.
  \item \textbf{Core Gameplay Pattern:} The turn-based matching mechanics (match by suit / match by value / sum-to-12 in Dozenal) are a stable product decision.
  \item \textbf{Non-functional goals baseline:} Performance targets (sub-300 ms updates), basic security expectations (TLS usage for network), and the expectation of GitHub-based CI.
\end{itemize}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.\\


The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in the Traceability Matrix in Section \ref{SecTM} (Table \ref{TblRT}). This decomposition ensures that each Functional Requirement (FR), Non-functional Requirement (NFR), and Safety Requirement (SR) has a clear owner in the design, facilitating implementation and verification.

For example, core gameplay logic (FR-1 to FR-5) is satisfied by the \mref{mGameEngine} and \mref{mRules} modules, while the user-facing presentation (FR-7, FR-9) is handled by frontend modules like \mref{mScoreboardView} and \mref{mGameBoardView}. Security and data persistence requirements (FR-10 to FR-17, SR-3, SR-8) are satisfied by the backend's \mref{mAuth} and \mref{mRepository} modules.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules}

\noindent\textbf{Design rationale:} The DAG above shows the server-authoritative pattern: Realtime gateway owns live interactions and forwards validated moves to the Game Engine; the Game Engine uses the Rules and Scoring modules, and persistence is abstracted via the Repository. Frontend views rely on the Realtime client for live updates and the API for non-realtime operations (profile, auth, lobby listing).

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}

The system uses two communication channels between the client (frontend) and the server (backend):

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Request--response channel (HTTP/REST).}
  This channel is used for operations that are naturally stateless and non real-time, such as account-related actions (e.g., login/logout), basic metadata queries, and health checks.
  Using a request--response protocol keeps these operations simple to debug, easy to cache (when applicable), and independent from long-lived real-time connections.

  \item \textbf{Real-time channel (bidirectional, event-driven).}
  This channel is used for time-sensitive game interactions that require low-latency updates, such as joining/leaving an active match, submitting player actions during gameplay, and receiving game state updates.
  A persistent bidirectional channel avoids polling and supports immediate state synchronization among participants.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Authority and consistency.}
The server maintains the authoritative game state.
Clients do not directly modify the canonical state; instead, clients send \emph{action intents} to the server.
The server validates each intent against the game rules and either applies it (followed by pushing the updated state) or rejects it (followed by an error response and/or a state resynchronization).
This server-authoritative design prevents rule inconsistencies between clients and reduces the risk of cheating.

\noindent \textbf{Client-side guidance (non-authoritative).}
To improve usability, the client may compute advisory hints (e.g., highlighting playable cards) based on the most recent state it has received.
These hints do not grant permission to act; the server remains the final arbiter of legality.
If advisory hints diverge from the server decision, the client UI must defer to the server response and the latest synchronized state.

\noindent \textbf{Session binding and access control.}
A user session (or equivalent identity) is established through the request--response channel and bound to the real-time connection when needed.
The real-time channel only accepts game participation and action submission from authenticated/authorized clients according to the system's access control policy.

\noindent \textbf{Failure handling and recovery.}
The protocol design supports transient network failures.
Upon disconnection and reconnection, the client can re-establish its session and request the latest game state to restore consistency.
Errors are surfaced as structured failures (e.g., invalid request, unauthorized access, invalid action, or missing game session) without exposing internal server details.

\noindent \textbf{Applicability.}
No special hardware--software communication protocol is required for this project; the communication protocols described above cover client--server interaction.
