\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.


\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes (completed)} \label{SecChange}

This section lists the project changes that we expect (``Likely Changes'') and those we consider unlikely within the capstone timeframe (``Unlikely Changes'').  Where applicable each anticipated change (AC) has been given an identifier to support traceability and to guide module secrets.

\subsection{Likely Changes (each becomes an AC / module secret)}
\begin{description}
  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acRules} \actheacnum\ --- Rule Engine Changes:] 
    The validation and behavioural details of the game's rule engine (e.g., how special cards behave, new house rules or alternate base arithmetic rules).  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Rules are likely to be refined during playtesting and instructor feedback, so they should be isolated in the \mref{mRules} module.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acBases} \actheacnum\ --- Numeric Base Support (Dozenal and beyond):] 
    Support for additional numeral systems (Octal, Hex, etc.), and how scores and hints convert and present values.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} We intend the product to be extensible to multiple bases; the conversion logic and scoring changes must be encapsulated in \mref{mBaseConversion}, \mref{mScoring}, and \mref{mScoreboardView}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acScoring} \actheacnum\ --- Scoring Formula / Presentation:] 
    Changes to how round or match scoring is calculated, aggregated or displayed (e.g., bonus rules, alternate tallying).  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Scoring may evolve after playtests; keep scoring logic isolated in \mref{mScoring}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acUI} \actheacnum\ --- UI and Interaction Patterns:] 
    Layout, hint presentation, animations, accessibility adaptations, and onboarding flow.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} UI polish and accessibility tweaks are frequent after usability sessions; the \mref{mAppShell}, \mref{mGameBoardView}, and \mref{mMoveController} should hide these secrets.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acSchema} \actheacnum\ --- Database Schema and Persistence Details:] 
    Changes to the persistent schema (profiles, history, telemetry format) and indexes.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Data collection needs evolve; the \mref{mRepository} module hides these details.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acRealtime} \actheacnum\ --- Real-time Messaging Strategy:] 
    Room lifecycle, message batching, reconnection rules, and state-resync semantics.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Real-time policies affect multiplayer stability; isolate them in \mref{mRealtimeGateway} and \mref{mRealtimeClient}.

  \item[\refstepcounter{acnum}\label{acAuth} \actheacnum\ --- Authentication and Session Policies:] 
    Token lifetime, guest-session semantics, password storage scheme, and auth flows.  
    \\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Security/configuration choices can change; these are hidden by \mref{mAuth} and the \mref{mAPI} interface.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes (explicitly documented)}
These items are not expected to change during the capstone, so they are \emph{not} treated as module secrets and are documented rather than encapsulated in a separate module secret:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Target Runtime Platforms:} Modern desktop browsers remain the deployment target for the deliverable.
  \item \textbf{Primary Tech Stack:} Web frontend framework, Server-side JavaScript runtime, Relational database for persistence.
  \item \textbf{Core Gameplay Pattern:} The turn-based matching mechanics (match by suit / match by value / sum-to-12 in Dozenal) are a stable product decision.
  \item \textbf{Non-functional goals baseline:} Performance targets (sub-300 ms updates), basic security expectations (TLS usage for network), and the expectation of GitHub-based CI.
\end{itemize}

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.\\


The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in the Traceability Matrix in Section \ref{SecTM} (Table \ref{TblRT}). This decomposition ensures that each Functional Requirement (FR), Non-functional Requirement (NFR), and Safety Requirement (SR) has a clear owner in the design, facilitating implementation and verification.

For example, core gameplay logic (FR-1 to FR-5) is satisfied by the \mref{mGameEngine} and \mref{mRules} modules, while the user-facing presentation (FR-7, FR-9) is handled by frontend modules like \mref{mScoreboardView} and \mref{mGameBoardView}. Security and data persistence requirements (FR-10 to FR-17, SR-3, SR-8) are satisfied by the backend's \mref{mAuth} and \mref{mRepository} modules.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented.

\subsection{Hardware Hiding Modules}

\noindent\textbf{Design rationale:} The DAG above shows the server-authoritative pattern: Realtime gateway owns live interactions and forwards validated moves to the Game Engine; the Game Engine uses the Rules and Scoring modules, and persistence is abstracted via the Repository. Frontend views rely on the Realtime client for live updates and the API for non-realtime operations (profile, auth, lobby listing).

\section{Design of Communication Protocols} \label{SecCP}

This section captures the protocol-level design for server-client communication, with a focus on login/auth flows (REST) and gameplay flows (WebSocket). The approach favours a server-authoritative model: the server is the source of truth for game state.

\subsection{Authentication and Profile (REST)}
\paragraph{Endpoints (HTTP/JSON)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{POST /api/auth/signup} \{ username, password \} $\rightarrow$ 201 / error
  \item \texttt{POST /api/auth/login} \{ username, password \} $\rightarrow$ \{ token, user \}
  \item \texttt{POST /api/auth/guest} $\rightarrow$ \{ token, guestId \}
  \item \texttt{GET /api/profile/:userId} Authorization: Bearer token $\rightarrow$ profile
  \item \texttt{PUT /api/profile/:userId} Authorization: Bearer token $\rightarrow$ updated profile
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Auth notes:} JWT-like Bearer tokens are issued on login and short-lived (configurable). Refresh tokens are out-of-scope for MVP but supported in design. Tokens are stored in secure HTTP-only cookies or in-memory (client decision in \mref{mAuthClient}).

\subsection{Real-time Gameplay (WebSocket / Socket.IO style)}
\paragraph{Connection lifecycle}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Client connects to the Realtime Gateway with an Authorization header (Bearer token).
  \item Server validates token, optionally checks profile/permissions, and assigns the socket to the user's session.
  \item Client requests to join or create a lobby room via \texttt{joinRoom / createRoom}.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Message schema (JSON) --- examples}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Client $\rightarrow$ Server:} \texttt{\{ type: "playCard", payload: \{ sessionId, action: \{ kind:"play", card:\{suit,rank\}, meta:\{\}\} \} \}}
  \item \textbf{Client $\rightarrow$ Server:} \texttt{\{ type: "drawCard", payload: \{ sessionId \} \}}
  \item \textbf{Server $\rightarrow$ Client:} \texttt{\{ type: "stateUpdate", payload: \{ sessionId, state: \{ hands, discardTop, turn, scores\} \} \}}
%  \item \textbf{Server $\rightarrow$ Client:} \texttt{\{ type: "actionResult", payload: \{ ok: true/false, reason?: "invalid_move" \} \}}
%  \item \textbf{Server -> Client:} \texttt{\{ type: ``reconnectSnapshot'', payload: \{ sessionId, fullState \} \}} (used on reconnection)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Protocol properties and constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Authoritative server:} All move validation occurs on the server (\mref{mRules}/\mref{mGameEngine}). Clients may do local pre-checks for responsiveness, but final acceptance comes from the server.
  \item \textbf{Idempotency:} Actions include client-generated request IDs so duplicate deliveries during reconnection are ignored.
  \item \textbf{Delta updates:} For performance, \texttt{stateUpdate} messages typically contain deltas; full-state snapshots are reserved for joins/reconnects.
  \item \textbf{Resync strategy:} On reconnect, the client requests a \texttt{reconnectSnapshot}. The server supplies a full state and the client applies it atomically to avoid inconsistent UI states.
  \item \textbf{Security:} All WebSocket connections are over WSS (TLS). Authorization is checked per message where required.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Example: Play Card flow}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Client sends \texttt{playCard} with action payload.
  \item Realtime Gateway authenticates and forwards the action to Game Engine worker.
  \item Game Engine validates via Rules module:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If accepted: update state, persist via Repository, emit \texttt{actionResult(ok:true)}, then emit \texttt{stateUpdate} to all room clients.
%      \item If rejected: emit \texttt{actionResult(ok:false, reason:"invalid_move")} to the initiating client.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Failure modes and mitigation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Dropped messages / short disconnects:} idempotent request IDs plus reconnection snapshot mitigate lost messages.
  \item \textbf{Lag / delayed updates:} server sends small heartbeats and uses sequence numbers so clients can detect missing updates.
  \item \textbf{Untrusted clients:} server always re-checks any client-supplied action against the Rules module — never trust client state for authoritative decisions.
\end{itemize}
